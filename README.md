Javascript Password Generator

This is an example of a random password generator. To start up the generator you click the "Generate Password" button. Once you do that, you will be asked a couple questions whether about what kind of password you would like.
    - Between 8-128 characters in length
    - Uppercase characters
    - Lowercase characters
    - Numbers
    - Special characters (ex. !@#$ etc).

After selecting your options, then your password will be generated and you can repeat the process again if you like.
